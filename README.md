As in, The major changes we would like to make will be ease to look for daily updated gas and propane prices as a columnand check if they are cheaper then the other options available.There will be another page for all deals going on at that timeand that will also help them choose the best cheap convenience store available nearby. There will be constant monitoring by the manager or any one employee on CONTACT US page where a customer can ask any query they have and the one accessing will answer that right away, saving their time to drive over there and getting disappointed of unavailability of that product. Moreover, after a healthy visit, people can give an honest feedback in a sectionindicating, that will help employ other people to give a visit and share their customer service experience as well.
